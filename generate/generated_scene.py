Creating a video to explain how a transformer model works using Manim involves visualizing the key components and operations within the transformer architecture. Below is a script that outlines these components, such as the attention mechanism, encoder and decoder stack, and positional encoding. This script aims to give a high-level overview of transformers suitable for educational purposes:

```python
from manim import *

class TransformerModelOverview(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Title
        title = Text("Transformer Model Overview", font_size=48)
        self.play(Write(title))
        self.wait(2)
        self.play(FadeOut(title))

        # Encoder Stack
        encoder_label = Text("Encoder Stack", font_size=36)
        encoder_stack = Rectangle(width=3, height=6, color=BLUE)
        self.play(Create(encoder_stack), Write(encoder_label.next_to(encoder_stack, UP)))
        
        # Attention Mechanism visual
        attention_circle = Circle(radius=1, color=YELLOW)
        attention_label = Text("Self-Attention", font_size=24).next_to(attention_circle, DOWN)
        self.play(Create(attention_circle), Write(attention_label))
        
        # Animation to show attention distribution
        attention_arrows = [Arrow(attention_circle.get_top(), encoder_stack.get_bottom())
                            for _ in range(3)]
        self.play(*[Create(arrow) for arrow in attention_arrows])
        self.wait(2)
        
        # Decoder Stack
        decoder_label = Text("Decoder Stack", font_size=36)
        decoder_stack = Rectangle(width=3, height=6, color=GREEN).next_to(encoder_stack, RIGHT, buff=1)
        self.play(Create(decoder_stack), Write(decoder_label.next_to(decoder_stack, UP)))

        # Positional Encoding Visualization
        pos_encoding_label = Text("Positional Encoding", font_size=24)
        pos_encoding_wave = FunctionGraph(lambda x: np.sin(x), x_range=[0, 2*PI], color=ORANGE)
        self.play(Create(pos_encoding_wave), Write(pos_encoding_label.next_to(pos_encoding_wave, DOWN)))
        
        # Connecting encoder and decoder stacks
        connect_arrow = Arrow(encoder_stack.get_right(), decoder_stack.get_left())
        self.play(Create(connect_arrow))
        self.wait(2)

        # Wrap up
        conclusion = Text("Transformers revolutionized NLP tasks!", font_size=32).shift(DOWN*3)
        self.play(Write(conclusion))
        self.wait(3)
```

### Explanation:
- **Title**: Displays an overview of the Transformer model.
- **Encoder Stack**: Visualizes the encoder part of the transformer which is responsible for processing input sequences.
- **Self-Attention**: Represents the attention mechanism that helps in capturing contextual information from the sequence. Arrows demonstrate how attention is distributed across the input.
- **Decoder Stack**: Represents how the model outputs the sequence prediction.
- **Positional Encoding**: Uses sinusoidal waves to demonstrate how positional information is encoded into sequences, allowing the model to understand order.
- **Connecting Arrows**: Illustrates the flow of information between encoder and decoder stacks.
- **Conclusion**: Highlights the impact transformers have had on natural language processing tasks.

Using Manim for this purpose provides an interactive and compelling visual representation that aids in understanding complex model architectures like transformers.
